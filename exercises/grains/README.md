# Grains

Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that the number
on each square doubles.

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king
promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up. Knowing that the
king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains
of wheat. One grain on the first square of a chess board, with the number
of grains doubling on each successive square.

There are 64 squares on a chessboard (where square 1 has one grain, square 2 has two grains, and so on).

Write code that shows:
- how many grains were on a given square, and
- the total number of grains on the chessboard

## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these
are some additional things you could try:

- Optimize for speed.
- Optimize for readability.

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this
experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read [D page](http://exercism.io/languages/d) on
exercism.io.  This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.

## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd).
Create just enough structure by declaring namespaces, functions, classes,
etc., to satisfy any compiler errors and get the test to fail.  Then write
just enough code to get the test to pass.  Once you've done that,
uncomment the next test by moving the following line past the next test.

```D
static if (all_tests_enabled)
```

This may result in compile errors as new constructs may be invoked that
you haven't yet declared or defined.  Again, fix the compile errors minimally
to get a failing test, then change the code minimally to pass the test,
refactor your implementation for readability and expressiveness and then
go on to the next test.

Try to use standard D facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.  [DRefLanguage](https://dlang.org/spec/spec.html)
and [DReference](https://dlang.org/phobos/index.html) are references to the D language and D standard library.
