# Circular Buffer

A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that
uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.

A circular buffer first starts empty and of some predefined length. For
example, this is a 7-element buffer:

    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

Assume that a 1 is written into the middle of the buffer (exact starting
location does not matter in a circular buffer):

    [ ][ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]

Then assume that two more elements are added — 2 & 3 — which get
appended after the 1:

    [ ][ ][ ][1][2][3][ ]

If two elements are then removed from the buffer, the oldest values
inside the buffer are removed. The two elements removed, in this case,
are 1 & 2, leaving the buffer with just a 3:

    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][3][ ]

If the buffer has 7 elements then it is completely full:

    [6][7][8][9][3][4][5]

When the buffer is full an error will be raised, alerting the client
that further writes are blocked until a slot becomes free.

The client can opt to overwrite the oldest data with a forced write. In
this case, two more elements — A & B — are added and they overwrite the
3 & 4:

    [6][7][8][9][A][B][5]

Finally, if two elements are now removed then what would be returned is
not 3 & 4 but 5 & 6 because A & B overwrote the 3 & the 4 yielding the
buffer with:

    [ ][7][8][9][A][B][ ]

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read [D page](http://exercism.io/languages/dlang) on
exercism.io.  This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.

## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd).
Create just enough structure by declaring namespaces, functions, classes,
etc., to satisfy any compiler errors and get the test to fail.  Then write
just enough code to get the test to pass.  Once you've done that,
uncomment the next test by moving the following line past the next test.

```D
static if (all_tests_enabled)
```

This may result in compile errors as new constructs may be invoked that
you haven't yet declared or defined.  Again, fix the compile errors minimally
to get a failing test, then change the code minimally to pass the test,
refactor your implementation for readability and expressiveness and then
go on to the next test.

Try to use standard D facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.  [DRefLanguage](https://dlang.org/spec/spec.html)
and [DReference](https://dlang.org/phobos/index.html) are references to the D language and D standard library.
