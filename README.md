Exercism exercises in the D Programming Language

## Filenames

Each exercise is identified by a slug.
The slug is all lower-case, and if it is multiple words, it is hyphenated.

E.g. `circular-buffer`.

The following conventions are used when adding a new exercise:

* Name the directory `$SLUG`
* Place the tests in `source/$SLUG.d`, replacing hyphens with underscores.
* Place the example solution in `example/$SLUG.d`, replacing hyphens with underscores.
* Add a file named `dub.sdl` with two lines: `name "$SLUG"` and `buildRequirements "disallowDeprecations"`.

E.g.

```
$ tree exercises/circular-buffer
exercises/circular-buffer/
├── dub.sdl
├── source
│   └── circular_buffer.d
└── example
    └── circular_buffer.d

2 directories, 3 files
```
